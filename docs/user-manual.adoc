== ​To Create a Mule Project in Anypoint Studio 7

The D2L connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Below is the *"Retrieve the current user context's user information"* operation for better understanding.

* Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure *HTTP Listener* to port 8081.

image::img/HTTP_Listener_Config.png[]

* Add "/getcurrentuserinfo" path to test the flow.

image::img/HTTP_Listener_Path.png[]

* Select *'Retrieve the current user context's user information'* operation from D2L module, drag & drop it into canvas. Click on the operation.
